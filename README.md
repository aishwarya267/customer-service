Customer CRUD operations demo project

REST APIs are developed to perform customer customer CRUD operations. The REST controller exposes APIs (POST, PUT, GET ,DELETE).
The Customer service interface exposes the functions for implementing CRUD operations. A repository for performing the DB operations
is created and data is stored and fetched from mongoDB. Custom exception handlers are created to handle exceptions.
